Cattle prices are down, the drought is on, and the note on the ranch is up. 

The Two-E Ranch is everything that Cass Elkins ever thought she wanted. Now that she has it, keeping it is the only thing she can't do. She needs a rain or a lot of cash. If the devil knocked on her door, she'd make a deal. After all, there are worse things. 

Like reality television. 

The devil doesn't show, so she tries out for the new reality program, "Tough Target." With a million dollars to win---minus taxes, of course---Cass hocks her dignity to save her pride. 

But the devil might have been easier.
